  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) subordinate [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) for
  the [Squid Reverseproxy charm](https://charmhub.io/squid-reverseproxy) that allows
  authentication digest or basic authentication using squid-auth-helper relation.

  As a subordinate charm this charm requires the [Squid Reverseproxy charm](https://charmhub.io/squid-reverseproxy)
  to be deployed and integrated with it.

  The charm brings digest or basic authentication support to the Squid Reverseproxy using the `squid-auth-helper` charm relation.
  It allows you to manage user credentials through charm actions (create-user, remove-user, list-users), and configure authentication
  parameters using charm configuration

  While the Squid Reverseproxy charm targets a "reverse proxy setup".
  This subordinate charm is currently only tested for a "forward proxy" use case.
